# Known issues

Currently none.

**When in doubt, chuck a water bucket at the server.**
1. Disable the problematic module with `.switch [module] disable`.
2. Write to config file so changes will persist over restarts with `.save`.
3. Reload config files so that the problematic is completely taken offline with `.reload`.
4. DM @siriusmart on Discord and get the issue fixed.
